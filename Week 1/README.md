# Mart220 Week 1

In this assignment, you are going provide a short description of the video wall project that you would like to create for the class project. If you are working in a group, please provide the team members and what you would like to do.

I'm not really sure what I would like to do, i think you mentioned that we could use the projector and a camera to sort of make an visual interactive piece so i think that would be pretty cool to do and have. I think i would want to work alone in the project!
